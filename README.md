## Algorithms

This repository contains efficient C++ implementations for algorithms useful in 
competitive programming.

I collect here non-trivial algorithms which might be useful for solving 
[CodeForces](https://codeforces.com)-style problems. Algorithms are implemented
in such a way that it's easy to quickly copy-paste them into solution. 

This repository is mostly for private use, but I don't mind anyone using the 
code as long as you are not violating any competition rules.

### Repository structure

Every file contains some algorithms as C++ functions and classes and main()
function which tests the algorithms and returns 0 if and only if all tests pass.

### References

* Most algorithms presented here are described on https://cp-algorithms.com/. 
  Some code was taken from that site.

### Useful submissions

Here is list of my successful submission on Codeforces which use some 
algorithms. I might check in some of them into this repository later.
